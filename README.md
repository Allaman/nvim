# My NeoVim Configuration

![](./screen.png)

This is my first Lua based NeoVim (>0.5) configuration. My goal was to achieve the same functionality as [my old vimrc](https://github.com/Allaman/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) and move onwards to a full Lua based configuration and Lua based plugins especially the promising builtin [LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) and [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).

As I am not familiar with Lua I tried to accomplish the migration with very basic and minimal use of its language features and make it just work and not make it beautiful ðŸ˜ƒ

## Structure

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ftplugin/  # file specific settings
â”œâ”€â”€ init.lua # lists all other Lua files to be sourced
â”œâ”€â”€ lua
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ autocmd.lua # vim autocommands
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ globals.lua # vim.g options
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mappings.lua  # all not plugin related mappings
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ options.lua # all not plugin specific settings
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/ # each plugin configuration is in its own file
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ plugins.lua # define plugins to be managed via Packer
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ui.lua # UI related config
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ user.lua  # TODO
```
