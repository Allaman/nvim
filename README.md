# My NeoVim Configuration

![](./screen.png)

This is my first Lua based NeoVim (>=0.6) configuration. My goal was to achieve the same functionality as [my old vimrc](https://github.com/Allaman/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) and move onwards to a full Lua based configuration and Lua based plugins especially the promising builtin [LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) and [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).

üíª This configuration is working on my [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) Linux as well as on my macOS!

Have a look at my [rice](https://github.com/Allaman/rice) how my Linux machine is configured and at my [mac-setup](https://github.com/Allaman/mac-setup) how my MacBook is configured. The Tmux configuration you can see in the image is [here](https://github.com/Allaman/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf) (as well as my other dotfiles).

## Motivation

There is a number of great NeoVim configurations online (see [Inspiration](#inspiration)) that give you a pleasant experience right out of the box. However, I am a long time (Neo)Vim user with a specific workflow and needs. Additionally, I do not have any Lua background and was not willing to spent too much time into that. Therefore, it was quite hard for me to customize and strip down the existing configs to my needs especially because the code is quite sophisticated.

So I decided to move to a fresh Lua based NeoVim on my own trying to accomplish the following principles:

## Principles

1. At least feature parity with my mentioned old vimrc (my lua config is superior almost since day one (or two üòâ)).
2. Migrate to Lua based alternative plugins.
3. Keep the config as simple as possible knowing that this would possibly impact the code quality.
4. Modular and meaningful directory structure and file naming.
5. Just make it work and not make it beautiful üòÉ. Of course, NeoVim itself must look beautiful but my Focus is not on beautiful code or on utilizing all Lua features.

## Features

### General ‚öôÔ∏è

- Package management and plugin configuration via [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

## Structure

Each plugin to be installed is defined in `plugins.lua` and each plugin has its own configuration file (if necessary) in `lua/config` which is loaded by packer.

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ after
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ftplugin      # file specific settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua          # main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autocmd.lua   # vim autocommands
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/       # each plugin configuration is in its own file
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mappings.lua  # Vim keymaps defintions -> config/which.lua for more
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua   # non plugin related (vim) options
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins.lua   # define plugins to be managed via Packer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin            # packer_compiled
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snippets          # snippets for vsnip
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spell             # my spell files linked from another repo
```

## Remove plugins

Basically, you can remove unwanted plugins by just removing the appropriate line in `./lua/plugins.lua` and, if applicable, delete its configuration file in `./lua/config/`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keep in mind that some plugins are configured to work in conjunction with other plugins. For instance, autopairs is configured in `./lua/config/treesitter.lua`. For now there is no logic implemented that cross-checks such dependencies.
