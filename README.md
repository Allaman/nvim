üíª This configuration works on my [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) Linux as well as on my macOS and requires Neovim >= 0.8!

Have a look at my [rice](https://github.com/Allaman/rice) how my Linux machine is configured and at my [mac-setup](https://github.com/Allaman/mac-setup) how my MBP is configured. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/Allaman/dotfiles) are also on GitHub.

## Motivation

There are many great Neovim configurations (see [Inspiration](#inspiration)), that give you a pleasant experience right out of the box, available. However, I am a long time (Neo)Vim user with a specific workflow and needs. Additionally, I do not have any Lua background and was not willing to spent too much time into that. Therefore, it was quite hard for me to customize and strip down the existing configs to my needs especially because the code is quite sophisticated.

I decided to move to my own fresh Lua based Neovim from my good old vimrc trying to accomplish the following principles.

## Principles

1. Migrate to Lua based alternative plugins respectively use only Lua based plugins (if possible).
1. Keep the config as maintainable as possible knowing that this would possibly impact the code quality.
1. Modular and meaningful directory structure and file naming.
1. Just make it work and not make it beautiful üòÉ. Of course, Neovim itself must look beautiful, but my focus is not on beautiful code or on utilizing all Lua features.

## Try out

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your system you can try out this config via the provided `Dockerfile`

üí° All dependencies of my config are installed except texlab, tectonic, and vim-grammarous which makes it at **1.9GB** a rather large image

### Build the image

There are some issues with building a multi architecture Docker image via GitHub Action. Until I sorted that out, you can build the Docker image locally on your own

```sh
docker build -t nvim .
```

### Just start nvim

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it nvim
```

### Mount a local directory (to ~/mount) and start nvim

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it -v ${HOME}/tmp:/home/nvim/mount nvim
```

### Start container in bash instead of nvim

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash nvim
```

## Installation

I created an installation [script](install.sh) that sets up all required tools on a fresh machine to work with my Neovim config.

For now, it works on Debian/Ubuntu and Arch. MacOS will be added soon.

üí°If you are a Tmux user have a look at vim-tpipelins's [requirements](https://github.com/vimpostor/vim-tpipeline#installation) for your tmux.conf and enable it in `./lua/core/settings.lua`.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

## Requirements

There are some tools that are required in order to use some features/plugins:

### Tools

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)

### LSPs, Formatting, Linters, DAP

The following programs should be installed on your system so that the appropriate tools can be installed:

- Go
- Python
- NodeJs > 12
- Cargo

#### Go

Go related dependencies are managed by `go.nvim` and are installed by running `:GoInstallBinaries` (when a Go file is loaded). They are installed in your `$GOPATH`.

#### All other

All other dependencies are managed by [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) and [Mason tool installer](https://github.com/WhoIsSethDaniel/mason-tool-installer.nvim). Tools are installed by running `:MasonToolsInstall` (in `vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "mason"`). [Mason requirements](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#requirements) must be available on your system.

For advanced spell checks via [vim-grammarous](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-grammarous) Java 8+ is required

## Structure

Each plugin to be installed is defined in `./lua/core/plugins/` and each plugin has its own configuration file (if necessary) in `lua/core/config/` which is loaded by packer.

`tree1 .`

```sh
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ after            # file specific settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua         # main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua/core        # lua configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin           # packer_compiled
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snippets         # snippets directory (luasnip style)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spell            # my spell files linked from another repo
```

`tree1 lua/core`

```sh
lua/core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autocmd.lua      # autocmds for various things
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config           # configuration folder for plugins
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.lua      # global functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mappings.lua     # key bindings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua      # vim options
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins          # plugins to be installed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packer.lua       # packer configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.lua     # user settings to configure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.lua        # utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ winbar.lua       # winbar configuration
```

## User configuration

The intention of my Neovim configuration was never to be a fully customizable "distribution" like LunarVim, SpaceVim, etc but from time to time I like to change my color scheme and the idea of making this configurable came to my mind. Based upon this idea I implemented some further lightweight configuration options that might be useful.

All options can be found in `./lua/core/settings.lua`.

## Remove plugins

Basically, you can remove unwanted plugins by just removing the appropriate table in `./lua/core/plugins/<file>.lua` and, if applicable, delete its configuration file in `./lua/core/config/`.

**Keep in mind that some plugins are configured to work in conjunction with other plugins. For instance, autopairs is configured in `./lua/vim/config/treesitter.lua`. For now there is no logic implemented that cross-checks such dependencies.**

## Add plugins

If you want to follow my method adding a plugin is straight forward:

To quickly test add in `lua/core/packer.lua` the plugin with the usual `use` syntax (within `packer.startup(function(use)...)`)

If you are confident that you will keep the plugin put it in an appropriate place in `./lua/core/plugins/<file>.lua`. A table for a plugin is just the same table as in `use({<this>})`.

Create `lua/core/config/<folder>/<name-of-the-plugin>.lua` where you put the plugins settings. If your plugin does not require additional configuration or loading you can omit the config part.

Open another instance of Neovim (I always try to keep one running instance of Neovim open in case I messed up my config) and run `PackerSync`.
