üíª This configuration works on my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) Linux as well as on my macOS. It requires and is tested with Neovim >= 0.10. It should run with Neovim 0.9.5 but I can't recommend it.

Have a look at my [rice](https://github.com/Allaman/rice) how my Linux machine is configured and at my [mac-setup](https://github.com/Allaman/mac-setup) how my MBP is configured. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/Allaman/dots) are also on GitHub.

## Motivation

There are many great Neovim configurations (see [Inspiration](#inspiration)), that give you a pleasant experience right out of the box, available. However, I am a long time (Neo)Vim user with a specific workflow and needs. Additionally, I do not have any Lua background and was not willing to spent too much time into that. Therefore, it was quite hard for me to customize and strip down the existing configs to my needs especially because the code is quite sophisticated.

I decided to move to my own fresh Lua based Neovim from my good old vimrc trying to accomplish the following principles.

## Principles

1. Migrate to Lua based alternative plugins respectively use only Lua based plugins (if possible).
1. Keep the config as maintainable as possible knowing that this would possibly impact the code quality.
1. Modular and meaningful directory structure and file naming.
1. Just make it work and not make it beautiful üòÉ. Of course, Neovim itself must look beautiful, but my focus is not on beautiful code or on utilizing all Lua features.

## Features

## Try out

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your system you can try out this configuration.

üí° Due to installing required tools like LSPs, CLI apps, etc. the image is approximately 3 GB large

### Dockerhub

There is a GitHub action in place that builds and pushes the Docker image to Dockerhub as `allaman/nvim`

#### Just start Neovim in container

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it allaman/nvim
```

#### Mount a local directory (to ~/mount) and start Neovim

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it -v ${HOME}/tmp:/home/nvim/mount allaman/nvim
```

#### Start container in bash instead of Neovim

```sh
docker run --name nvim --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash allaman/nvim
```

### Build the image

You can also build the image on your own

```sh
docker build -t nvim .
```

Replace `allaman/nvim` in the former commands with just `nvim`.

## Requirements

There are some tools that are required in order to use some features/plugins:

Run `:checkhealth core` to check the status.

### Tools

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

For the neo-tree delete functionality:

- [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)

For Latex functionality:

- [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) (can be changed in `config.lua`)
- [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) (can be changed in `config.lua`)

### LSPs, Formatting, Linters, DAP

The following programs should be installed on your system so that the appropriate tools can be installed:

- Go
- Python
- NodeJs > 12
- Cargo

#### All other

All other dependencies are managed by [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim). Tools are installed by running `:MasonToolsInstall` (in `vim.fn.std path("data") .. "mason"`). [Mason requirements](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#requirements) must be available on your system.

## Bindings

Some bindings can be overwritten in your user config file. See `./lua/core/config/defaults.lua` for possible settings.

Each plugin to be installed is defined in `./lua/core/plugins/` in a separate file.

## User configuration

The intention of my Neovim configuration was never to be a fully customizable "distribution" like LunarVim, LazyVim, SpaceVim, etc. but from time to time I like to change my color scheme and the idea of making this configurable came to my mind. Based upon this idea I implemented some further configuration options that might be useful.

The default configuration can be found in [./lua/config/defaults](./lua/config/defaults/).

You can overwrite any of this configuration by writing a `.nvim_config.lua` file that follows the same structure as the default table and pick only those keys that you want to modify. Have a look at my user configuration in my [dots repo](https://github.com/Allaman/dots/blob/main/dot_nvim_config.lua.tmpl). The configuration file should be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `$HOME`, or the windows equivalent path.

You can start with `cp ./config-example.lua $HOME/.nvim_config.lua`.

## Remove plugins

You can remove unwanted plugins by just removing the appropriate file in `./lua/core/plugins/`. Lazy will take care of removing the plugin. You should also clean up any default configurations in [./lua/config/defaults](./lua/config/defaults/).

**Keep in mind that some plugins are configured to work in conjunction with other plugins. For instance, autopairs is configured in `./lua/core/plugins/treesitter.lua`. For now there is no logic implemented that cross-checks such dependencies.**

## Add plugins

If you want to follow my method adding a plugin is straight forward:

Create a file in `./lua/core/plugins/` following the expected format of Lazy.

Open another instance of Neovim (I always try to keep one running instance of Neovim open in case I messed up my config) and run `Lazy sync`.
